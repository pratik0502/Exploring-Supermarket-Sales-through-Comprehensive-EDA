# Exploring-Supermarket-Sales-through-Comprehensive-EDA
Data Gathering: The first step was to gather the data on supermarket sales.

Data Cleaning: The data was cleaned to ensure that it was free of any errors or inconsistencies.

Data Visualization: The data was visualized using various plots such as bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots to understand the distribution of the data.

Univariate Analysis: Univariate analysis was performed to understand the distribution of individual variables.

Bivariate Analysis: Bivariate analysis was performed to understand the relationship between two variables.

Multivariate Analysis: Multivariate analysis was performed to understand the relationship between multiple variables.

Feature Engineering: Features were engineered to better understand the data and make it easier to model.

Insights: The insights gained from the EDA were documented and used to guide further analysis and modeling.

Overall, the project aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the supermarket sales data through various EDA techniques.
